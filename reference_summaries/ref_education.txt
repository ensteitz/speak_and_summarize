Sir Ken Robinson opens his TED Talk by discussing how education has deep roots that extend past time in school. Whether education is something as simple as a conversation starter or as bonding as having the same alma mater, Sir Ken Robinson shares anecdotes on how education plays a role in various aspects of life. He then argues that as children grow up they get educated out of creativity because of a growing fear of failure. This is emphasized by a personal anecdote of seeing the difference in education systems between the UK and US and of how social heirarchy is dependent on1 academic ability. Several more anecdotes are shared to emphasize how important it is to adopt a new conception of human ecology.
