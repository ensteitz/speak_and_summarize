In this TED Talk, Alison Ledgerwood dissects the reason why so many people rhuminate on rejections negative experiences for longer than they celebrate and enjoy positive ones. To address how easy it is to shift perspective, an experiment was performed where the participants were given a procedure to contemplate, and they were told that it had a certain success or failure rate. The results of this and other experiments led Alison to deduce that for the majority of people, the view of the world tends to tilt toward the negative. As such, it takes more work and effort to get out of a negative mindset. Even though our minds might be skewed toward the negative, Alison motivates the audience to challenge their negative thoughts and react to them with positive ones in hopes of reprogramming negative brains to become more positive.
